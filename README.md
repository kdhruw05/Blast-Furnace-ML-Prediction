# Blast-Furnace-ML-Prediction
## Overview
This repository contains the work conducted during my internship at Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL). The project focused on predicting critical operational parameters of a blast furnace, particularly the CO/CO₂ ratio, using advanced machine learning techniques. Accurate predictions help optimize operations, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact.

## Features
Developed a Random Forest Regressor to predict the CO/CO₂ ratio with an R² score of 0.92.
Automated hourly predictions for the next 4 hours.
Improved prediction accuracy by reducing errors by 15%.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to derive meaningful insights.
## Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Tools:
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
Model Evaluation: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R² Score
